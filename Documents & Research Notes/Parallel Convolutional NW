My thoughts in designing the architecture where as follows. 
Letters and numbers are largely defined by the orientation of lines 
and position. To capture the orientation I included two parallel 
convolution paths with either vertical or horizontal orientation.  
The average pooling helps determine the net orientation for that region.
The square convolution helps consolidate this information. 
The locally connected layer helps define and amplify the important regions of interest. 
The rest was mostly trial and error.
