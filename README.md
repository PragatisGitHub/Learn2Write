# Learn2Write
Learn2Write is an interactive learning tool designed to evaluate Penmanship skills using a trained computer model. 

Our PROJECT has many applications including teaching young children and those who are new to English as well as those using physical therapy to regain mobility and hone their writing skills after injury or stroke. Additionally future builds will be able to evaluate lower case letters, beginning letter sounds, text to speech, cloud deployment, more user friendly GUI and more!
